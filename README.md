# INCECT-ROBOT
This project is based the robotics which is built using arduino board and other Hardware things.

Like many other arduino robots, our robot can also avoid obstacles using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. TThere are random values generated in the arduino sketch to make Walter decides when he wants to stop to rest, and also to randomly changes his gait speed (3 speeds).
